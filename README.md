# E-Mail_Finder_Verifier
Python code to find and verify the email of a user based on the given first name, last, name and domain name. 
Currently facing a timeout issue in the code when trying to connect to the dns server to find out the subdomain of the host, let me know if you can find a fix around the same. Requires dns/dnspython module to run successfully.
